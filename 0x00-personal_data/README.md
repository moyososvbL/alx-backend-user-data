Personally identifiable information (PII) and personal data are two classifications of data that often cause confusion for organizations that collect, store and analyze such data. 

PII is used in the US but no single legal document defines it. The legal system in the United States is a blend of numerous federal and state laws and sector-specific regulations. They all define and classify different pieces of information under the PII umbrella. 

On the other hand, personal data has one legal meaning, which is defined by the General Data Protection regulation (GDPR), accepted as law across the European Union (EU). 

Both terms cover common ground, classifying information that could reveal an individualâ€™s identity directly or indirectly.
